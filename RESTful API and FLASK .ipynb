    "Q.1   What is a RESTful API ?\n",
    "ANS: A RESTful API is an application‑level interface that strictly adheres to the architectural style known as Representational State Transfer (REST), originally defined by Roy Fielding in 2000. It operates over HTTP, exposing resources at logical URIs and manipulating them via standard HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.2  Explain the concept of API specification ?\n",
    "ANS: An API specification is a formal‑ized blueprint—typically in a machine‑readable format—describing how an API behaves and how clients can interact with it. It outlines what endpoints exist, HTTP methods, query/body headers, request/response data schemas, status codes, authentication, and error formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.3  What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs? \n",
    "ANS:  Flask is a micro web framework for Python—first released in 2010 by Armin Ronacher via the Pallets Project. Built on Werkzeug (WSGI toolkit) and Jinja2 (templating engine), Flask provides only the core essentials: URL routing, HTTP request/response handling, a simple dev server, and debugging tools. It does not include built-in database abstractions, form validation, or user‑authentication layers. Instead, these are provided via optional extensions (e.g. Flask‑SQLAlchemy, Flask‑RESTful etc.) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.4  What is routing in Flask? \n",
    "ANS:   Routing is the mechanism by which Flask takes an incoming HTTP request (like GET /users/123) and dispatches it to the correct Python function (called a view function) based on the URL path and HTTP method. It maps URL patterns to functions that generate a response (e.g. HTML, JSON, redirect). routing is a key feature of any web framework—it determines how the address in your browser matches the content served\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.5   How do you create a simple Flask application?\n",
    "ANS:  1.  Set Up a Virtual Environment & Install Flask\n",
    "To isolate dependencies and keep your global Python clean:\n",
    "\n",
    "python3 -m venv venv\n",
    "source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "pip install Flask\n",
    "This is the recommended workflow for small Flask apps and labs. (SitePoint / turn0search4)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create Your First Flask App File\n",
    "Create a file named app.py (don't call it flask.py; that will shadow the Flask module):\n",
    "\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def hello():\n",
    "    return 'Hello, World!'\n",
    "Flask(__name__) initializes your WSGI app.\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/') binds the route / to the hello() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The return value is implicitly served with text/html content type. (Flask Official Quickstart / turn0search0)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Run the Development Server\n",
    "You have two simple options:\n",
    "\n",
    " Option A: Use the Flask CLI:\n",
    "\n",
    "export FLASK_APP=app     # On Windows: set FLASK_APP=app\n",
    "flask run\n",
    "Since your file is named app.py, Flask auto-discovers it without needing --app. (turn0search0)\n",
    "\n",
    " Option B: Just run the script directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "python app.py\n",
    "If your code has:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "Then the app starts when run directly. Debug mode enables auto-reload and helpful error messages. Avoid both in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Test It\n",
    "Go to your browser at: http://127.0.0.1:5000/\n",
    "You should see Hello, World!\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in development server listens at port 5000 by default for testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.6  What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n",
    "ANS:  HTTP methods used in the RESTful API are as follows: \n",
    "Method\tSafe? (No state change)\tIdempotent? (Repeatable safely)\n",
    "GET\t\n",
    "HEAD\t\n",
    "OPTIONS\t\n",
    "PUT\t\n",
    "DELETE\t\n",
    "POST\t\n",
    "PATCH\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.7   What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask? \n",
    "ANS:  The @app.route() decorator in Flask is used to define a route, which maps a specific URL path to a Python function (called a view function) that should handle requests to that path.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.8   What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n",
    "ANS:  GET vs POST — Core Differences in RESTful Web APIs\n",
    "GET:  should only retrieve data without changing server state. Because GET URLs can be prefetched or replayed silently (e.g. by web crawlers), any mutations via GET break the HTTP convention and can lead to serious side-effects \n",
    "\n",
    "POST:  is designed to modify server state—commonly used to create new resources (like a comment or order). Sending the same POST multiple times may create duplicate entities, hence not idempotent by design \n",
    "\n",
    "GET uses a URL path and query string for parameters (pid).\n",
    "\n",
    "POST reads a JSON payload from the request body and responds with 201 Created.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "GET—side-effect free, idempotent, fetch by parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "POST—potentially side-effect–creating, payload‑driven, not safe/idempotent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.9 How do you handle errors in Flask APIs ?\n",
    "ANS: Handling errors well is crucial for building reliable, user-friendly Flask APIs. Here’s a guide to designing structured error handling, with best      practices, examples, and code snippets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. How do you connect Flask to a SQL database ?\n",
    "ANS: To connect a Flask application to a SQL database, the most common approach is using Flask-SQLAlchemy, an extension that integrates SQLAlchemy          with Flask.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy ?\n",
    "ANS: Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension for Flask that integrates the SQLAlchemy ORM (Object Relational Mapper) into your Flask applications. It              simplifies database interactions by providing a higher-level abstraction over SQLAlchemy, making it easier to work with relational databases in        Flask.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12. What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?\n",
    "ANS: Flask Blueprints are a powerful feature that allow you to organize and modularize your Flask application by grouping related views, templates,         static files, and other code into reusable components. This approach enhances the scalability, maintainability, and clarity of your codebase,          especially as your application grows in complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q13. What is the purpose of Flask's request object?\n",
    "ANS: In Flask, the request object is a central component that encapsulates all incoming HTTP request data, providing a convenient interface to access       various aspects of the request. It is automatically available in view functions and is essential for handling client interactions in a Flask           application.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q14. How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask? \n",
    "ANS: Step 1: Install Flask\n",
    "            First, ensure you have Flask installed. If not, you can install it using pip:\n",
    "            pip install flask\n",
    "     Step 2: Define the API Endpoint\n",
    "             from flask import Flask, jsonify, request\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "tasks = [\n",
    "    {'id': 1, 'title': 'Learn Flask', 'done': False},\n",
    "    {'id': 2, 'title': 'Build RESTful API', 'done': False}\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/tasks', methods=['GET'])\n",
    "def get_tasks():\n",
    "    return jsonify({'tasks': tasks})\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/tasks', methods=['POST'])\n",
    "def create_task():\n",
    "    new_task = request.get_json()\n",
    "    new_task['id'] = len(tasks) + 1\n",
    "    tasks.append(new_task)\n",
    "    return jsonify({'task': new_task}), 201\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q15. What is the purpose of Flask's jsonify() function? \n",
    "ANS: In Flask, the jsonify() function is a utility designed to simplify the process of returning JSON responses from your application. It automatically serializes Python data structures into JSON format and wraps them in a Flask Response object with the appropriate MIME type (application/json).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q16.  Explain Flask’s url_for() function?\n",
    "ANS:  Flask, the url_for() function is a utility that dynamically generates URLs for your application’s routes, promoting cleaner, more maintainable         code. Instead of hardcoding URLs, which can lead to errors and require updates across multiple files when routes change, url_for() allows you to       reference routes by their endpoint names. This approach ensures that your application remains flexible and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q17. How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)? \n",
    "ANS: Flask provides built-in support for serving static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images. By default, it expects these files to be located in a directory named static within your application. This setup allows Flask to automatically serve these files when requested by the client. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q18. What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API?\n",
    "ANS: An API specification is a formal document that defines the structure, behavior, and constraints of an API. It serves as a blueprint that outlines      how the API should function, including details about endpoints, request/response formats, authentication methods, and error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q19. What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API ? \n",
    "ANS: HTTP status codes are standardized three-digit numbers returned by a server in response to a client's request. They indicate the outcome of the        request and help clients understand how to proceed. In Flask APIs, these codes are crucial for effective communication, error handling, and            debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q20. How do you handle POST requests in Flask?\n",
    "ANS: Handling POST requests in Flask is essential for processing data sent by clients, such as form submissions, JSON payloads, or file uploads.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q21. How would you secure a Flask API?\n",
    "ANS: Securing a Flask API is crucial to protect sensitive data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure the integrity of your application. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q22. What is the significance of the Flask-RESTful extension? \n",
    "ANS: Flask-RESTful is a Flask extension that simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs by providing tools for routing, request parsing, and response          formatting. It allows developers to build APIs that are modular, maintainable, and adhere to REST principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q23. What is the role of Flask’s session object?\n",
    "ANS: In Flask, the session object plays a crucial role in persisting user-specific data across multiple HTTP requests within the same session. This is      particularly useful for maintaining user authentication states, storing user preferences, or tracking items in a shopping cart.\n",

    "Q1. How do you create a basic Flask application ? \n",
    "ANS:  Step 1 – Create & Activate a Virtual Environment\n",
    "A virtual environment keeps your Flask project contained and avoids version conflicts:\n",
    "\n",
    "python3 -m venv venv\n",
    "source venv/bin/activate       # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate\n",

    "Flask(__name__) initializes your Flask app.\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/') binds the root URL to the hello_world function.\n",
    "\n",
    "debug=True enables hot-reloading and helpful errors during development. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4 – Run Your Flask App\n",
    " Option A: Using python\n",
    "\n",
    "python app.py\n",
    "This runs the file directly thanks to the if __name__ == '__main__': guard. \n",
    "\n",
    "Option B: Using Flask CLI\n",
    "\n",
    "export FLASK_APP=app.py\n",

    "On PowerShell, use $env:FLASK_APP = \"app.py\" and $env:FLASK_ENV = \"development\". \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach cleanly separates environment and application code.\n",
    "\n",
    " Step 5 – Visit and Test Your App\n",
    "By default, Flask runs on 127.0.0.1:5000:\n",
    "Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to see Hello, World!\n",
    "Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/about/ to see the “This is a Flask web app.” message.\n",
    "You can use tools like curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to test from the terminal.\n",
    "This minimal example is the foundation of every Flask app. You can now expand with routes, templates, API endpoints, and even databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.2  How do you serve static files like images or CSS in Flask\n",
    "ANS: 1. Default Behavior: the /static/ route\n",
    "By default, if you do:\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "Flask automatically creates a route at GET /static/<path:filename> that serves files from a folder named static/ located next to your app module \n",
    "\n",
    "No extra routes or manual code needed—you just put your assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts) under a static/ directory and Flask will pick them up.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Organizing Your Project\n",
    "Standard file layout:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "project/\n",
    "├── app.py\n",
    "├── static/\n",
    "│   ├── css/\n",
    "│   │   └── style.css\n",
    "│   ├── js/\n",
    "│   │   └── app.js\n",
    "│   └── images/\n",
    "│       └── logo.png\n",
    "└── templates/\n",
    "    └── index.html\n",
    "To include CSS / images in your template:\n",
    "\n",
    "<link rel= stylesheet\" href=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='css/style.css') }}\">\n",
    "<img src=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='images/logo.png') }}\" alt=\"Logo\">\n",
    "<script src=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='js/app.js') }}\"></script>\n",
    "Flask’s url_for('static', ...) generates the correct URL even if you mozillaevnt serve static from a different place later\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. Custom static_folder or static_url_path\n",
    "If you want Flask to pick up a different folder (say assets/) or use a different URL prefix (e.g., /assets/), configure the Flask instance like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__,\n",
    "            static_folder='assets',\n",
    "            static_url_path='/assets')\n",
    "Now:\n",
    "\n",
    "Files live under assets/ on disk\n",
    "\n",
    "URLs are /assets/css/style.css instead of /static/...\n",
    "\n",
    "You still reference assets with url_for('static', filename=...)—Flask resolves it automatically \n",
    "\n",
    " 4. Static Files in Flask Blueprints\n",
    "When using Blueprints, each Blueprint can define its own static folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "admin_bp = Blueprint('admin', __name__,\n",
    "                     static_folder='static',                 # <-- folder inside blueprint\n",
    "                     static_url_path='/admin/static')      # <-- customizable URL\n",
    "Then access via:\n",
    "\n",
    "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{ url_for('admin.static', filename='admin.css') }}\">\n",
    "Note: If you register the Blueprint with no url_prefix, Flask’s root /static/... will conflict, so you’ll need to give it a static_url_path or url_prefix in that Blueprint registration \n",
    "\n",
    " 5. Serving Files from Other Directories\n",
    "Suppose you have user-uploaded media stored outside the default structure (e.g. in uploads/). To serve those files:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "from flask import send_from_directory\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/uploads/<path:filename>')\n",
    "def uploaded_file(filename):\n",
    "    return send_from_directory('uploads', filename, as_attachment=False)\n",
    "send_from_directory() ensures safe path handling and guards against directory traversal attacks—the recommended way to serve files from outside the official static folder \n",
    "\n",
    " Avoid send_file() or send_static_file() with unvalidated user input, since it can accidentally expose sensitive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Handling Cache & Cache-Busting\n",
    "Browsers aggressively cache static files. To change static files without users needing to hard-refresh:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Flask’s configuration to control cache TTL:\n",
    "\n",
    "app.config['SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT'] = 600  # e.g. 10 minutes\n",
    "Or, more commonly, add a version parameter to URLs:\n",
    "\n",
    "<link rel=\"stylesheet\"\n",
    "      href=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='css/style.css') }}?v={{ app_version }}\">\n",
    "Both strategies ensure users get updated files when the version changes without forcing a manual reload \n",
    "\n",
    " 7. Best Practices & Gotchas\n",
    " Always use url_for('static', ...)\n",
    "Hard‑coding paths like /static/style.css may break if your app is mounted under a subpath or you change the static config later:\n",
    "\n",
    "“If the base URL … changes … you’re covered by using url_for … Otherwise you’re going to wind up changing the base URL for every static file” \n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t write url_for inside CSS files\n",
    "url_for() works only inside Jinja‑rendered templates or inline <style> blocks. For production CSS files, hard-code relative paths (e.g. url('../images/bg.jpg')), or generate CSS using a build step.\n",
    " App in Debug Mode\n",
    "When using app.run(debug=True), Flask will reload updated static files instantly—but cached copies might still linger in the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "8. Moving to Production\n",
    "While Flask’s built-in static server is fine for development or low‑traffic sites, it isn’t optimized for serving large static assets efficiently. For production:\n",
    "Let your reverse proxy or web server (e.g. Nginx or Apache) serve /static/ or /assets/ directly from disk.\n",
    "Configure your web server to cache these files with expires headers (e.g. max-age=31536000, immutable) for long-lived content.\n",
    "This setup frees up your Flask app to handle only API or dynamic requests, improving scalability and response time\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.3  How do you define different routes with different HTTP methods in Flask? \n",
    "ANS:   1. Single Route with Multiple Methods\n",
    "from flask import Flask, request, jsonify\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/item', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\n",
    "def item():\n",
    "    if request.method == 'GET':\n",
    "        return jsonify(items), 200\n",
    "    elif request.method == 'POST':\n",
    "        new = request.get_json()\n",
    "        items.append(new)\n",
    "        return jsonify(new), 201\n",
    "Flask defaults a route to GET (and HEAD) only unless you explicitly specify methods=[...]. Otherwise, POST returns a 405 Method Not Allowed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the view function, you can branch behavior based on request.method. \n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Separate Routes (One Function per Method)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/item', methods=['GET'])\n",
    "def get_items():\n",
    "    return jsonify(items), 200\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/item', methods=['POST'])\n",
    "def create_item():\n",
    "    new = request.get_json()\n",
    "    items.append(new)\n",
    "    return jsonify(new), 201\n",
    "This splits GET and POST into separate view functions, improving modularity and readability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Routing still happens on the same URL; Flask dispatches to the correct function based on HTTP method. \n",
    "\n",

    "Q.15 How do you capture URL parameters in Flask? \n",
    "ANS:  You can capture two types of URL parameters in Flask routes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Path parameters (route variables)\n",
    "These are embedded in the URL pattern and passed as function arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    " Flask route syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/user/<username>')\n",
    "def show_user(username):\n",
    "    return f'Hello {username}'\n",
    "This extracts \"alice\" in /user/alice and passes it as username.\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/post/<int:post_id>')\n",
    "def show_post(post_id):\n",
    "    return fPost #{post_id}\n",
    "The int: converter ensures post_id is cast to an integer, or the route wont match otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " Multiple path segments (catch-all)\n",
    "If you need to handle trailing slashes or deeper paths:\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/docs/<path:subpath>')\n",
    "def docs(subpath):\n",
    "    return f\"Docs path: {subpath}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters are automatically passed to your view function as named arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Query parameters (after ? in URL)\n",
    "These appear after ? and are accessed via request.args.\n",
    "\n",
    "from flask import request\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/search')\n",
    "def search():\n",
    "    name = request.args.get('name')      # returns first \"name\" if multiple present\n",
    "    sort = request.args.get('sort', 'recent', type=str)\n",
    "    page = request.args.get('page', 1, type=int)\n",
    "    return f'search name={name} sort={sort} page={page}'\n",
    "request.args is an ImmutableMultiDict with parsed key/value strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "get() optionally specifies a default and type=… callable to safely convert the input.\n",
    "Use getlist() to retrieve repeated keys—e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "tags = request.args.getlist('tag')  # [\"python\",\"flask\", ...]\n",
    "You can also use request.args.to_dict(flat=False) to return all values as lists.\n",
    " Raw query string or full URL\n",
    "If you need the unparsed URL or raw string:\n",
    "\n",
    "request.url           # e.g. \"http://.../search?name=john\"\n",
    "request.query_string  # returns b\"name=john\"\n",
    "These are useful for logging or error pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Accessing parameters outside the view function\n",
    "If you need to inspect the path params from extensions, middleware, or before_request hooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "value = request.view_args.get('username')\n",
    "\n",
